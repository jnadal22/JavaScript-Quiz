# JavaScript-Quiz

This was challenge 4 for the javascript quiz challenge. with being new to javaScript this was very challenging. I struggled to make things work in this challenge.

##changes:
working with guidance, I was able to get the questions to display and time to subtract if the wrong answer was selected. It's definitley a work in progress.
